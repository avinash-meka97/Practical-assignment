```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(scales)
theme_set(theme_light())
```



```{r}
thanksgiving_meals<-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-11-20/thanksgiving_meals.csv")
```


#1 
#Display the first 10 numbers
```{r}
thanksgiving_meals%>%head(10)
```
#1 ans- Displaying the first observations from the dataset using head(10) function.



#2
#Use fct_reorder and parse number to factor variable family_income.
```{r}
thanksgiving_meals%>%
  mutate(family_income = fct_reorder(family_income, parse_number(family_income)))
```
#2 ans- fct_reorder is used to reorder a factor where it is mapped to a position.Parse_number function is a non-numeric characters before or after the group. Here family_income is used to reorder and parsed to make a factor.



#3
#Generate the statistics using summary and skim functions to display the types of the variables in a dataset.
```{r}
thanksgiving_meals%>%summary()
thanksgiving_meals%>%skim()
```
#3 ans-Summary function is used to produce result summaires of various types in the dataset.Skim function can also be used as an alternative function to summary and additionally also displays all data types of the variables in the dataset thanksgiving_meals.




#4
#To count the people who celecrate thanksgiving.
```{r}
thanksgiving_meals%>%count(celebrate,sort = TRUE)
```
#4-ans Count function is used to calculate the unique values of the variables to show the total number of observations under the variables.



#5
#What are categories and stats for each main dish served and the method it is prepared?
```{r}
stats<-thanksgiving_meals%>%
  count(main_dish,main_prep,sort = TRUE)
```
#5 ans-categories is a new different dataset extracted from thanksgiving_meals to save the maindish served and process used to prepare it.



#6
#Data viz to plot the maindish served and the method used to prepare it.
```{r}
stats%>%ggplot(aes(n,main_dish,fill=main_prep))+geom_col()+theme(legend.position = "top")
```
#6 answ--ggplot is a function used plot various graphs models for a specific values in a dataset.A plot is marked between maindish and maindish preparation.



#7
#Count the people who choose cranberry sauce and gravy.
```{r}
thanksgiving_meals%>%count(gravy,sort = TRUE)

thanksgiving_meals%>%count(cranberry,sort = TRUE)
```
#7 ans--To individually calculate the total number of people using gravy and cranberry.



#8
#Distribution of people who celebrate thanksgiving based on their income.
```{r}
family_celebrate<-thanksgiving_meals%>%
  group_by(family_income)%>%
  summarise(celebrate = sum(celebrate == "Yes"))%>%ungroup()
```
#8 ans--family_celebrate is a new dataset extracted from thanksgiving and grouping the people based on their family incomes and summarising them on celebration of thanksgiving.Finally ungrouping them.



#9
#Dataviz for people who celebrate thanksgiving based on their income.
```{r}
family_celebrate%>%
  ggplot(aes(celebrate,family_income))+
  geom_point()
```
#9 ans- Plotting a geom_point with the criteria of celebration vs family_income.



#10
#The most commonly choosen sides, pies and deserts in a dataset.
```{r}
common<- thanksgiving_meals%>%
  select(id, starts_with("side"),
         starts_with("pie"),
         starts_with("dessert")) %>%
  select(-side15,-pie13,-dessert12)%>%
  gather(type, value,-id)%>%
  filter(!is.na(value),
         !value %in% c("None", "Other (please specify)"))%>%
  mutate(type = str_remove(type, "\\d+"))

common<-common%>%
  count(type,value,sort = TRUE)
```
#10 ans-Selecting the most common sides, pies and deserts from the dataset using select function.In the given dataset thanksgiving_meals filter function is used to filter the NA values and gathering them and adding the variable count to the dataset using mutate function.Counting the all observations in common using count function.



#11
#Dataviz to provide the common sides, pies and deserts.
```{r}
common%>%
  ggplot(aes(n,value,fill = type))+
  geom_col()
```
#11 ans- Presenting geom_col for the common sides,pies and deserts.




#12
#How do the servings differ by income?
```{r}
servings<-thanksgiving_meals%>%
  select(id, starts_with("side"),
         starts_with("pie"),
         starts_with("dessert"),
         starts_with("main_dish")) %>%
  select(-side15,-pie13,-dessert12)%>%
  gather(type, food,-id)%>%
  filter(!is.na(food),
         !food %in% c("None", "Other (please specify)"))%>%
  mutate(type = str_remove(type, "\\d+"))

servings<-servings%>%
  inner_join(thanksgiving_meals)%>%
  mutate(income = parse_number(family_income))%>%
  group_by(food)%>%
  summarise(family_income)%>%
  arrange(family_income)

servings<-servings%>%count(food,family_income,sort = TRUE)
```
#12-ans-Created a new dataset which drawed from the main dataset thanksgiving_meals to store the observations of servings varied by income.Initially used the function innerjoin and mutating coloums matching rows based on the common sides, pies and desserts. Grouping them by food along with summarising by family_income, as which which food will be selected by the which family_income category and then arranged to the family_income. Counting the total observations from the dataset servings.



#13
# Present this information on a data viz
```{r}
servings%>%ggplot(aes(family_income,food))+geom_point()
```
#13-ans Marking a point between family_income and food choosed by the people using ggplot function.
